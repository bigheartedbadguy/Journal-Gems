<h2>CSS background-image</h2>
<p>The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.</p>
<p>By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.</p>
<p>A bad combination of text and background image will result in the text being hardly readable which isn't good for user interface.</p>
<p>When using a background image, use an image that does not dosturb the text.</p>
<p>The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the p element</p>
