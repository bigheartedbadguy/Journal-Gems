<p>The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.<br>
Multiple HTML elements can share the same class</p>
<br><hr>
<h1>Using THe Class Attribute</h1>
<p>THe class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.</p><br>
<p>In the following example we have three div elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three div elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:<a href="html29.html">Example of Class Attribute with the Div element</a></p>
<br>
<p>In the following examplewe have two span elements with a class attribute with the value of "note". Both span elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section:<a href="html30.html">Example of Class Attribute with the span element</a><br>
<b>The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.<br>
THe class name is case sensitive!</b></p>
<br>
<h2>THe Syntax For Class</h2>
<p>To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:<a href="html31.html">Creation of a class named "city"</a></p>
<h3>Multiple Classes</h3>
<p>HTML elements can belong to more than one class.
To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. div class="city 
main". The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.
In the following example, the first h2 element belongs to both the city class and also to 
the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes:<br>

<h4>Different Elements Can Share Same Class</h4>
<p>Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.
In the following example, both h2 and p point to the "city" class and will share the 
same style:<br>

<h2>Use of The class Attribute in JavaScript</h2>
<p>The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific 
elements.
JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the 
getElementsByClassName() method:<br>
