<h1>HTML Images Syntax</h1>
<p>The HTML img tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The img tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The img tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image</p>
<h2>The src Attribute & The alt Attribute</h2>
<p>The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets 
the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make 
sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the 
web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken 
link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.
</p>
<br>
<p>The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).</p>
