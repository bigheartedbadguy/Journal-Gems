 	<h1>Completely New Entry</h1>
 	<p>Wow, I think its been 5 days since I did this but things are slowly getting in order,<b>SLOW AND STEADY</b>, I starting to think its all about having control over the body and mind insteasd of just doing it. Why, because things tend to spiral out of order when you arent payimg attention with ones body. Woww look at me just one day into this I seem the wise one</p>

 	<p><b>Anyways Stay Disciplined and keep moving 
 	TIMESTAMP: 21:47</b>, yes  I did nothing but its fine

 	<h2>HTML CSS</h2>
 	<p><b>TIMESTAMP = 07:48</b>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
	CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of 
	multiple web pages all at once.
	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the 
	layout of a webpage.
	With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size 
	of text, the spacing between elements, how elements 
	are positioned and laid out, what background images 
	or background colors are to be used, different 
	displays for different devices and screen sizes, and 
	much more!
 	</p>
 	<br>
 	<p>cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!</p>
