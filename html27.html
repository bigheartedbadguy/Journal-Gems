<p>The div element is used as a container for other HTML elements.</p>
<h1>The Div Element</h1>
<p>The div element is by default a block elememnt, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.<br>

</p>
<h2>DIV as a Container</h2>
<p>The div element is often <b>used to group sections of a web page together.</b>

<h2>Center Align a div ELement</h2>
<p>If you have a div element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto.Like this:<br>

<h1>Multiple Div ELements</h1>
<p>You can have many div containers on the same page.Like this:</p>
<hr>
<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Oslo</h2>
  <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
  <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Rome</h2>
  <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
  <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<h1>Aligning div elements side by side</h1>
<p>When building web pages, you often want to have two or more div elements side by side, like this:<br>

<br>
<h2>Float</h2>
<p>The CSS float property was not originally meant to align div elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years.

The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allow elements float next to each other instead of on top of each other.<br>

<br><hr>
<h2>Inline-block</h2>
<p>If you change the div element's display property from block to inline-block, the div elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.<br>
<div>More Specific Example</div>

<br>
<h2>Flex</h2>
<p>The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible 
responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
To make the CSS flex method work, surround the div elements with another div element 
and give it the status as a flex container.<br>

<h2>Grid</h2>
<p>The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the div elements with another div element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.<br>
