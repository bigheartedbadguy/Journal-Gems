<h1>HTML Links - Hyperlinks</h1>
<p>HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will 
turn into a little hand.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can 
be an image or any other HTML element!</b></p>
<h2>HTML Links - Syntax</h2>
<p>The HTML a tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
<img src="C:\Users\Rodney Mukarati\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (1).png" alt="Example of syntax" ></p>
<hr>
<p>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red</p>
<h3>HTML Links - The target Attribute</h3>
<p>By default, the linked page will be displayed in the 
	current browser window. To change this, you must 
	specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked 
document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/
tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
FOr EXAmple:

<h4>Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs</h4>
<p>Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
<img src="C:\Users\Rodney Mukarati\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (3).png" alt="Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs" ></p>
